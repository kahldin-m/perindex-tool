description: |
  Serana Vale is one of the last Warden‑Cartographers, a guild of
  explorers tasked with mapping the shifting northern frontier.
  She is methodical, fiercely independent, and known for returning
  from expeditions that should have killed her.

  Her maps are prized not only for accuracy but for the strange
  annotations she leaves—cryptic symbols, warnings, and notes
  written in a code only she seems to understand.

notes:
  personality:
    - Pragmatic but not unkind
    - Sleeps lightly; distrusts enclosed spaces
    - Keeps meticulous journals, one per expedition
  rumors:
    - "Claims she once saw the sky split open during a storm."
    - "Some say she can sense magnetic fields."
    - "Believed to be hiding a map she refuses to share."

history: |
  Born in the storm‑lashed coast of Veyr, Serana grew up among
  sailors and navigators. She joined the Order of Ink at sixteen
  and quickly earned a reputation for surviving expeditions that
  claimed more seasoned Wardens.

  Her most recent journey into the northern frontier ended with
  half her team missing and her journals sealed under guild lock.
